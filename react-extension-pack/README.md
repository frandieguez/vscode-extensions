# React Extension pack

VS Code comes with a ton of features for React development out of the box. This extension pack adds more!

These are some of my favorite extensions to make React development easier and fun.

## Extensions Included

- Reactjs code snippets - Adds code snippets for React development in ES6
- ES Lint - Integrates ESLint into VS Code.
- npm - Run npm scripts from the command palatte and validate the installed modules defined in package.json.
- JavaScript (ES6) Snippets - Adds code snippets for JavaScript development in ES6 syntax.
- Search node_modules - Quickly search for node modules in your project.
- NPM IntelliSense - Adds IntelliSense for npm modules in your code.
- Path IntelliSense - Autocompletes filenames in your code.
